- **Use Cases:** 
  - Efficiently handles large datasets using arrays.
  - Performs complex computations and operations on data with speed and efficiency.

### 2. Pandas
- **Description:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Loads data into DataFrames, simplifying the management of large datasets.
  - Provides functions for filtering, aggregating, and analyzing data in an intuitive manner.

### 3. Matplotlib
- **Description:** A versatile plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Generates high-quality plots, charts, and histograms.
  - Visualizes trends and distributions in the Zomato dataset.

### 4. Seaborn
- **Description:** A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Creates visually appealing statistical graphics.
  - Enhances the aesthetics of plots, making them more informative and easy to interpret.
